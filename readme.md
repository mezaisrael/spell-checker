Spell checker is a class project where we have to take a file(check_it.txt) and check if there are any misspelled words. A misspelled word in this case simply means a word that is not in our dictionary file.

errors and suggestions are printed on two file, set_test.txt and unordered-test.txt. The algorithm was implemeneted twice to compare the speeds between a set(AVL tree) and an unordered_set(hash).
